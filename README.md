# THIS IS THE REL 8 ADMIN PROJECT

## Major Technologies Used

1. **react**: frontend framework(no type script).
2. **styled-components**: for styling.
3. **react-router-dom**: for routing.
4. **zustand**: for global state management and state perisitence to localstorage.
5. **axios**: http client.
6. **react-query**: for api response management.
7. check the pacakge.json for the other packages

# Project Structure (important files and what they do)

#### src

1. zustand folder: the global state manager made using zustand, stores the login cred. to localstorage
2. responsive.js: used for style responsiveness. using styled-components css import.
3. global.js: the color scheme.

#### src/utils

This folder controls the api calling and axios instance implementation

#### src/components

1. SideBar: contains the top navbar and the sidebar(also the reposnive one).
2. Modals: All modals to create an new feature(payments, news, publications) are stored here.
3. Dues: This represent the payment info, didnt change it so as to not affect imports
4. **ActionComponents**: contains **ActionComponents1** and **ViewMoreInfo**
   -- **ActionComponents1**: Store all the tables for each and every section.
   -- **ViewMoreInfo**: Stores the modals for each tables action buttons. So if any table displays a modal after click of an action button the action button and it functionalities are stored here.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
